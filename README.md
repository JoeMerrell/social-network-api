## Description

This is the challenge for module 18 for UCLA's Coding Bootcamp. From the assignment description: 

"Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps."

## Installation


Users may clone the github repo onto their own hard drives (this is not a full app - no front end). Dependencies include Express.js, mongoose, and moment (the date library I chose for the assignment). The github repo: https://github.com/JoeMerrell/social-network-api


## Usage

Since this isn't an app with a front end, users may test the routes using an API client such as Insomnia or Postman. A demo video of the various routes can be found here: https://youtu.be/0vL7I9OfiGo
